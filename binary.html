      <h1>Project Eir</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Our group proposes to create a plan for a Robot for Natural Disaster Assistance to assist rescue efforts in the aftermath of a natural disaster. This project is artificial intelligence robot which plan for detecting and rescue in natural disasters. The robot will operate autonomously in the disaster area without manual operation. This robot is used to detect victim’s status, location and other conditions, and then send information to rescue worker in order to formulate a rescue plan. The robot carries a radar and life detector that can greatly increase detecting efficiency. Due to the fact that the condition of disaster area is very complex, many rescue operations rely on manpower could be limited, even cause casualties to rescuers, hence AI robot for natural disasters will bring many benefits to human society. As such in Norse mythology, people sought guidance from the Goddess of Healing, Help and Mercy; Eir, thus naming this project: <b>Project Eir</b>.
</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">These robots will be mostly in the form of drones where their small size will be an advantage in navigating urban environments. Where these environments would be too dangerous and life threatening to on-the ground disaster response teams to enter, either due to large and unpredictable obstacles caused by the natural disasters destruction. On top of this, the surrounding environment may be contaminated with radiation and/or chemicals that render rescue attempts impossible. These AI controlled drones are able to act on their own to swiftly navigate complex terrain, through its environmental analysis and radar; sending information on distressed individuals as well as environment condition. These drones being small and compact means that many can be easily transported in masses and be deployed at the affected area which will increase the efficiency of the searches as it will cover more areas faster and assist rescuers in locating survivors. Not only can this robot be used for natural disasters it can also be used to help locate those who are lost and require rescue.

      <h1>Project Motivation</h1>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">According to the UN report(2015). Since 1995, natural disasters such as floods, storms, and earthquakes have caused more than 606,000 deaths worldwide, and 4.1 billion people have been injured or rendered homeless. However, the reason that some people were injured and caused the death was not the disaster itself. For example, the earthquake. In general, the main shock of the earthquake lasts only ten seconds. Earthquakes pose little direct danger to a person. Because people can't be shaken to death by an earthquake. One of the main reason is buildings can be damaged by the shaking itself which can destroy buildings and hurt people. However, there was no way to stop the disaster. Therefore, the first 72 hours after a disaster are crucial, and response must begin during that time to save lives. However, the secondary disaster caused by the earthquake will complicate the rescue scene that the rescue team can not enter the scene to start rescues, such as debris flow and flood. In addition, if the earthquake happened in some special place, such like the nuclear power plant, it not only will have a huge impact on the rescue work, but it will also cause harm to rescue workers. Hence, the Robot (AI) for natural disasters can solve the problem, which can adapt to various hazardous environments and have AI system that is able to analyze the situation and make decisions extremely quickly.
</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">More often than not, rescue personnel are not able to access and enter areas that prose a significant risk to the lives of the people conducting the rescue. As the environment after a natural disaster is rendered dangerous and immensely unpredictable. To combat this problem, there needs to be a method to traverse and enter dangerous areas where normally people cannot so that an accurate position of people and/or animals are in distress for the live personnel to act on. Without this solution, there leaves a significant time delay between rescuing a person or animal that's trapped under rubble or is in a position that needs immediate medical attention before their life is lost. This issue is disheartening to the rescue personnel as well as the families and acquaintances of the person whose life was lost, due to the fact that rescue attempts are hindered by the dangerous environment. A robot drone that's able to act as a middle-man sending information about targets and environment analysis enables rescue personnel to act swiftly and safely to rescue a target.

      <h1>Project Aim</h1>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">With Project Eir, our ultimate aim is to produce assistant technology to help in natural disaster and rescue efforts to lower the risk of lost of life due to rescue personnel being unable to reach distressed individuals in time. In which the time it takes for rescue personnel to reach and save an individual is dependent on factors such as; vulnerability and threat of the surrounding environment including weather conditions, location of distressed individuals or potential risks that pose a threat to the rescuers themselves. Here at Team Binary, Project Eir’s goal is then to provide rescuers a safe and well-thought out plan to tackle these risk factors in order to reduce the amount of time taken for a rescue. By doing so, it effectively decreases the potential of loss of life. To achieve this ultimate goal, Project Eir would be visualised as an AI or semi-AI driven robot, ideally in the form of a small-factor drone. With this form factor, the drone will be about to be dispatched rapidly, and be able to fit in almost all size and forms of environments. Equipped with the drone, would be sensory devices, which highlights one of the secondary goals, which is to provide as much sensory and analytical information about the surrounding conditions and most importantly the relative position of a distressed individual.
